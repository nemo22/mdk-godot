# MDK gameplay internals

Reverse engineered from `MDKD3D.EXE`. Function names refer to
[`tools/ghidra/names.txt`](../tools/ghidra/names.txt). World units are called "u"; Z is up in MDK
coordinates. Items marked *(inferred)* weren't verified line by line.

## Timing (`timer_update`, `timer_compute`)

- The game logic is tick-based at **30 ticks per second**, measured with 120 Hz sub-ticks.
- `0x491e20` is the frame time in ticks (smoothed: 0.75·previous + 0.25·raw), `0x491e24` the frame
  time in seconds, `0x491e18` the number of whole ticks (≥ 1, clamped to 4).
- A frame limiter waits until 34 ms have passed (≈ 29.4 fps). There is one physics step per frame,
  scaled by the frame time.
- Animations advance one frame per tick, except Kurt's run animation (see below).

## Kurt ("Damp") movement

Kurt's state is the animation state at `0x573a70`:

| State | Animation | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 100 | `K_STILL` | Standing (plays once, holds the last frame) |
| 101 | `K_IDLE` | Idle animation |
| 200 | `K_LAND` | Landing |
| 201 | `K_SURF` | Surfing |
| 300 | `K_SHOT` | Shooting while standing |
| 400 | `K_TRN45` | Turning in place (frame from the rotation angle) |
| 500 | `K_SIDE` | Strafing |
| 600 / 601 | `K_RUN` / `K_RUNFIR` | Running (firing); footstep sounds on frames 0 and 13 |
| 700 / 701 | `K_FALL` / `K_CHUTE` | Falling / chute |
| 702 / 703 | `K_JUMP` / `K_RJMP` | Jumping standing / running |
| ≥ 800 | | Hanging from a ledge, special modes |

### Horizontal (`damp_move`, `input_read_axes`, `vel_accel`, `vel_friction`)

Speeds per tick (× 30 for per second):

| | Normal | Turbo (Shift) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Acceleration (forward, backward, strafe) | 0.04444 u/tick² | 0.08889 u/tick² |
| Maximum speed | 0.6667 u/tick (20 u/s) | 1.3333 u/tick (40 u/s) |
| Keyboard turn acceleration | 0.9 °/tick per frame | 1.3 °/tick per frame |
| Keyboard turn maximum | 4 °/tick (120 °/s) | 6 °/tick (180 °/s) |

- Pressing the opposite direction resets the speed to one acceleration step (`vel_accel_dt`).
- Without input, speed decreases by 0.17778 u/tick² above 0.6667 u/tick, and by 0.08889 u/tick²
  below, times 1.0 on a floor, 0.75 in the air, 0.1 on slippery floors (floor triangle flag 0x04).
  The strafe acceleration uses the same factors (0.5 on slippery floors).
- Turning slows down by 1.6 °/tick² above 4 °/tick, 0.55 °/tick² below.
- Mouse turning sets the turn speed to 3 × clamp(mouse dx / sensitivity / dt, ±4) °/tick.
- Movement: yaw −= turn × dt; dx = (vf·cos yaw + vs·sin yaw)·dt; dy = (vf·sin yaw − vs·cos yaw)·dt.
- The camera rolls by up to ±10° while running and turning (±0.25 °/tick), decaying by
  clamp(0.35·|roll|, 0.05, 2.5) °/tick.

### Vertical (`damp_vertical`, `damp_gravity`)

- Gravity 64 u/s², falling speed capped at 250 u/s.
- Jump: vertical speed 40 u/s (peak ≈ 12 u), when on the ground and the key was released since the
  last jump. During the first 6 ticks, releasing the key subtracts the remaining ticks × 3.333 u/s.
- Falling faster than 16 u/s starts the fall (700), or the chute (701) if the jump key is held.
- Chute: gravity 21.33 u/s², falling speed braked (256 u/s²) to 8 u/s.
- Landing faster than 100 u/s is a hard landing (probably damage *(inferred)*).
- The floor is found by the downward collision sweep (no separate height query). Moving platforms
  are found by a ray from z + 3 to z − 3 (`damp_platform_floor`).
- Ledge grab (`damp_ledge_grab`): while falling and pushing forward, a segment at head height
  (+4.604) is tested; the ledge must be flat (|nz| ≥ 0.85) and faced within 30°, with room above.

### Kurt's run animation (`damp_run_anim_frame`)

The frame advances by `rate` frames per tick, with u = forward speed (u/tick) × 1.5:
rate = 0.75u + 0.25 up to u = 1, then 0.25u + 0.75. It plays backwards when backing up.

## Collision (`damp_collide_move`, `bsp_sweep_box`)

- Kurt is an axis-aligned box swept through the arena BSP.
  - Horizontal sweeps: half extents (0.6, 0.6, 2.5) centered at z + 3 (so obstacles lower than
    0.5 u are stepped over); 4 slide iterations; slides only if (m·n)² ≤ 0.75·|m|², so walls within
    30° of head-on stop him.
  - Vertical sweeps: half extents (0.4, 0.4, 2.5) centered at z + 2.51.
- Planes with |nz| < 0.75 are walls: the steepest walkable slope is about 41°.
- Near arena borders, the neighboring arena is also tested. Objects are tested with segment versus
  bounding box.
- Conveyor belts (`conveyor_push`) add their velocity, depending on the floor triangle's material.

## Firing

The fire key (held) sets `0x573a38` in `damp_move` (unless Kurt is in a state class ≥ 8), which
starts the looping chain gun sound and asks for the firing animation: `K_SHOT` (state 300) when
standing, `K_RUNFIR` (state 601, footsteps on frames 4 and 17) when running. `damp_animate` clears
the muzzle flash every frame and, while firing, every other frame picks the next of the 4 `K_MUZZF`
frames at random (`(previous + rand(3) + 1) & 3`) with a random 0–4 pixel offset added to a
per-state base: turning and strafing (0, 0), falling (40, 6), jumping (0, 0), running jump
(0, −10), chute (20, 0), surfing (−42, 12). `damp_sprite_draw` draws the flash's hotspot at Kurt's
hotspot plus that offset, before (behind) Kurt. The hits are described in
[engine.md](engine.md#kurts-chain-gun-0x41a304).

## Pickups (`damp_collect_pickups` 0x46c448)

Every frame Kurt takes the pickups of his arena (flag 0x200000, not already taken: 0x40000) that
the segment from his previous to his current position crosses; a pickup's box is its bounds grown
by 1 unit, and 5 downwards. Taken pickups get flags 0x41000 and vanish in 30 ticks.

- **Used at once** (table 0x4920e0, 0x46d478): sniper ammo `SW_HOME`, `SW_SGREN`, `SW_HGREN`,
  `SW_LGREN`, `SW_BONES` (+8, 3, 3, 8, 1 of ammo type 1–5 at `0x5743f3`, halved on hard when above
  1, and that type is selected); health `SW_H25` (+10, up to 100), `SW_H50` (+50, up to 100),
  `SW_H100` (at least 100), `SW_H150` (at least 150), `SW_H01` (+1, up to 100); `SW_EWJ` and
  `BONEFLC` are easter eggs. Sounds: `APPLE` for health, `BONES`, otherwise `COLLECT`.
- **Inventory** (table 0x4921ac: 5 slots of 0x24 bytes at `0x57432c`, count `0x5743e0`, selection
  `0x5743e4`): 1 `SW_DUMMY` (decoy), 2 `SW_INTER` (the World's Most Interesting Bomb, sound
  `WMIB`), 3 `SW_TWIST` (tornado), 4 `SW_THUMP` (mortar), 5 `SW_HBOMB` (grenades: 5/3/1 per pickup on
  easy/normal/hard, 1 in `DANT_2`), 6 `SW_GATT` (super chain gun: 400/200/100 ticks of 6× damage,
  `0x5743ef`), 7 `SW_KEY`, 8 `SW_SEAL`, 9 `SW_SBONE`. Grenades and the super chain gun stack in their
  slot; other pickups need a free slot (at most 5), else Kurt leaves them. The new item is selected
  (except the super chain gun).
- Scripts see a taken pickup through its flag 0x40000 (`if_flag_40000`).

## Damage and death (`hurt_kurt` 0x46a604, `damp_control`)

- Damage is ignored while Kurt is invulnerable (`0x573bd4`), dead or in some states; it's 2/3 on easy
  (at least 1) and doubled on hard. Each hit adds `damage × 25` to the red flash `0x573b70`
  (kept within 75–180, −4 per tick).
- At 0 health, once on the floor, Kurt plays `K_BANG` (state 1002) and holds its last frame; the
  `SKULL` image fades in at the centre of the view (`0x573b70` going up to 255), then the game loads
  the last saved game (`LASTGAME`).

## HUD (0x41e128)

Drawn on the 600×360 view after the 3D scene:

- **Health** (0x420830): the `SC_STAT` image at the bottom right (`600 − (w + 16)`, `360 − (h + 10)`)
  with the health in its middle, in the digits of `SNIP_TXT` (8 pixels wide, 0x420bd0); the number
  blinks (16 ticks out of 32) at 20 or less, and every other frame while invulnerable.
- **Inventory** (0x46cce4): for 60 ticks after a change (`0x574328`), or always in sniper mode, the
  items' `PICKUPS` icons (frame = item type − 1) at `(32 + 48 × slot, 328)` with their count above
  when above 1 (the super chain gun shows its ticks); new items fly there from the pickup's place on
  screen. The selected slot is framed (`48 × slot + 8…+0x37`, 304–351).
- A boss health bar at the top (0x41f540, up to 500 pixels) while `0x573c74` > 0.
- Messages (0x425474): a queue of up to 4 texts (pickup names, …) shown one after another.
- In sniper mode: zoom level, ammo types (`SNIP_L1`–`SNIP_L6`, `SNIP_W1`–`SNIP_W6`) and counts,
  range (`SNIP_RNG`).

## Camera (`camera_update`)

- Distance D = 8 u behind Kurt's feet, pivot height H = 4.5 u (4.0 in sniper mode).
- Pitch p (positive looks down) = the arena's pitch (DTI block 2, eased as 0.85·old + 0.15·new per
  tick) + the look offset (look up/down keys, 90 °/s, total −60…+90°, returns at 200 °/s)
  − 40 × smoothed vertical speed + min(air ticks × 0.667, 40) while airborne (decays at 40 °/s).
- Position: feet + facing·(5(1 − cos p) − D·cos p) + up·(H + D·sin p) when p > 0; without the
  5(1 − cos p) term otherwise, and with D·(p + 100)/80 below −20°.
- The camera never gets closer: if a wall is between Kurt's head (z + 5.5) and the camera, Kurt is
  pushed away from it (`camera_clearance`).
- Projection: the 3D view is 600 × 360 with a focal length of 250 px: horizontal FOV 100.4°,
  vertical FOV 71.5°.

## Kurt's sprite (`damp_sprite_draw`, `rle_draw_hotspot`)

Kurt is a 2D sprite: his feet are projected to the screen, and the frame's top-left corner is drawn
at (x − hotspot x, y − 101 − hotspot y), at 1 sprite pixel per pixel of the 600 × 360 view (no
scaling with distance). The Direct3D version draws it as a quad at Kurt's depth. With the default
camera, a 144-pixel frame is about 4.8 u tall, matching his collision box.
